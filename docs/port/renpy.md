## From Ren'py To Monogatari
If you already have a Ren'py game and would like to export it to Monogatari, you can do it very easily. As you may have seen the syntax is pretty much the same so you'll only need to change some letters, add some commas and you'll be ready to go!

You can take a look to the script of The Question in [Ren'py](http://www.renpy.org/doc/html/thequestion.html) and [Monogatari](http://monogatari.hyuchia.com/TheQuestion/js/script.js) Scripts so you can compare and learn more!

## Vibration

You can make the mobile phones that support this feature vibrate! to do so, you just need the vibrate command which syntax is:

If you want it to vibrate once: **"vibrate [time]"**
If you want it to vibrate in a pattern: **"vibrate [time] [time] [time] ..."**


The following will make the device vibrate for 100 miliseconds.
```javascript
"vibrate 100"
```

While this will make it vibrate in a pattern:
```javascript
"vibrate 100 200 300 200 100"
```

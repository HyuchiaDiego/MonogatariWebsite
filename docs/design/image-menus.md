## Image Menus

Many use Image Menus for their interfaces, however, I really discourage this in Monogatari. It's fairly easy to do it as you can see in [this tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_map.asp) however using image maps is not good for the responsiveness and since we want everyone to be able to enjoy our game, I really encourage you to do everything using HTML and CSS. Sure, the buttons, headers, texts etc. can have background images, but try to avoid using them as the main interface.

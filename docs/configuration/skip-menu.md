## Skip Menu

You may not want to have a main menu, in order for the game to start right away after the user enters.

To do that, just change the "ShowMenu" property in the options.js.

This property default value is `true` meaning it will show the Main menu.

```javascript
"ShowMenu": true
```

To skip it, just change the value to `false`:

```javascript
"ShowMenu": false
```

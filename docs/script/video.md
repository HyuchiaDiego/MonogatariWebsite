## Video

Sometimes images and sound is just not enough and a video is needed. As always, you need to declare it first.

To view the supported formats, you can take a look at [this page](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_video.asp).

```javascript
var videos = {
    "Dandelion": "DandelionTimelapse.mp4"
}
```

Then just use the command "Play" to play it!.

```javascript
"play video Dandelion"
```
